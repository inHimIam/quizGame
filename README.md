This is a quiz game styled after Jeapordy
I am building this for after talking to my mother and hearing her struggles with finding an app that she can re-use for quizing her classes.  

The features of this app will be the following:  
    - Interface:  
        + an tabled interface for topics and point values arranged in collumns  
        + player scoreboards  
        + count down timer  
        + minor animations  
        + music and sounds  
  
    - Backend  
       + editable, capeable of saving changes for questions and answers to re-use over and over  
       + needs to be able to function w/o internet connection
